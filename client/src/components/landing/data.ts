export const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How does the AI story generation work?',
    answer: 'Our AI uses advanced language models trained on narrative structures to help expand your ideas into full stories. You provide the summary or concept, and the AI generates detailed narratives while maintaining consistency in characters, plot, and tone.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I edit the AI-generated content?',

  {
    question: 'What are multi-angle image prompts?',
    answer: 'Multi-angle prompts provide 6 different camera perspectives for each scene (main, close-up, wide-shot, over-shoulder, dutch-angle, birds-eye). This is perfect for filmmakers, animators, and content creators who need comprehensive visual references.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does character continuity work across episodes?',
    answer: 'Our system maintains a master character database for each series, tracking visual descriptions, personality traits, and story arcs. This ensures your characters remain consistent across all episodes in a series.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I export my stories?',
    answer: 'Yes! Pro and Studio plans include export features in multiple formats including PDF, Word documents, and plain text. You can also copy content directly from the interface.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a limit to story length?',
    answer: 'Free users can create stories up to 10 minutes in duration (approximately 1,500 words). Pro users have unlimited length, and you can customize duration to match your needs (5, 10, or 30-minute formats).',
